## Project Description
This web application is designed specifically for medical professionals to manage their daily appointments and patient interactions seamlessly. Created using HTML and CSS, the app features a clean and intuitive interface that displays a doctor's profile, daily schedule, and upcoming consultations. Each doctor has their own profile, allowing for a personalized experience. The layout is responsive, ensuring that the application is functional and aesthetically pleasing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Personalized Doctor Profile**: Each user is greeted by their profile photo, name, and a summary of the day's remaining consultations upon logging in.
- **Daily Consultation Overview**: Consultations are organized by day within the main dashboard, with details such as patient name, appointment type (remote or in-person), and time displayed in an easy-to-read card format.
  - **Interactive Consultation Cards**: Each card provides essential information about an appointment, including options for direct communication with patients (visual representation only, not functional).
  - **Quick Access Buttons**: For remote consultations, cards include buttons for initiating video or audio calls. For in-person appointments, a button to view the address is available (buttons are visually represented but not functional).
- **Weekly Schedule Navigation**: Users can view their schedule for the week with appointments neatly grouped under each day.
- **Fixed Sidebar Menu**: Includes quick links to Consultations, Clients, Reports, and a main Menu, with hover effects that change the text color for better user interaction.
- **Responsive Mobile Design**: On mobile devices, the sidebar menu shifts to the bottom of the screen for better accessibility, and a fixed circular button provides additional navigation options.
  - **Expandable Circular Menu Button**: This feature allows users to access more options by tapping on a circular button, enhancing usability on touch devices.
