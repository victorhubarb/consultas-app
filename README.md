## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: Creation of cards with separation by upcoming days, containing detailed information about the appointment such as location, time, and more. Additionally, buttons for actions such as video call for remote consultations and view address for in-person appointments are included directly on the card.
- `Feature 2`: Responsive page, developed for different screen sizes. The page adjusts its content respecting the screen sizes, for example, using a fixed navigation menu at the bottom of the page for smaller screens, and a left-side navigation menu with the screen divided into 2 sections for larger screens.
- `Feature 3`: A floating button with a blue plus sign at the bottom right of the screen, just above the floating navigation menu. When clicked, it opens a menu with several other options for the user.
